## Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/otrinanda/celerates-assessment.git
cd celerates-assessment
```
2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
4. Open the app in your browser at  [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)


## Environment Variables

Create a .env.local file in the root directory and define the following environment variables:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com
```

## API Documentation
This application fetches user data from the JSONPlaceholder API:
* GET /users - Fetch a list of users
* GET /users/id - Fetch a specific user
* PUT /users/id - Update existing user information
* POST /users/id - Create new user information

## How It Works
1. Users are fetched from the API and displayed.
2. Users can select and edit a user profile.
3. Validation ensures proper data entry.
4. Users can generate and download a PDF of the profile.

## Assumptions & Decisions
* The app only supports editing user data locally (no real update to API since JSONPlaceholder is a mock API).
* PDF export includes watermark and company branding.

## Deployment
To build and start the production version:
```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```
